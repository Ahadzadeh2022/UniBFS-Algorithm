** To employ the algorithm for gene selection, the UniBFS_ReliFish and Fit functions were utilized. Tables 5, 6, and 7 present the results obtained using these functions. For data classification, the UniBFS_ReliFish_2 and Fit_2 functions were applied. The findings in Tables 9 and 10 are derived from these functions.

*** The Python code implementing the UniBFS_ReliFish algorithm will be incorporated in the future.
